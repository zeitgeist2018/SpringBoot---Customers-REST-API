# SpringBoot---Customers-REST-API
This is the backend RESTFull API for the customers management system, to be used toghether with the frontend written in Angular, that resides in my other repository SpringBoot-Customers-Angular-Frontend

## Run it
You can import this code into Eclipse JEE and run it, then clone the Angular Frontend repository and run it as well, so they can talk each other.
